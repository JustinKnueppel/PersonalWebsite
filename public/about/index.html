        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          In May 2021, I graduated summa cum loude from The Ohio State
          University with a B.S. in Computational Data Analytics. Additionally,
          I completed extensive coursework on software engineering, algorithms,
          and design patterns.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          In August of 2020, I joined the Comcast Cybersecurity team as a
          Security Developer Contractor. This role allowed me to work in a
          fast-paced and technologically advanced team and learn many industry
          leading technologies. I quickly became hired full time and have been
          promoted to a Senior Software Engineer where I lead project
          development on our next-gen platform. I have gained extensive
          experience and expertise working with and deploying to
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/"
            >Kubernetes</a
          >
          and

          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/"
            >AWS</a
          >
          using
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/"
            >Terraform</a
          >
          and various AWS SDKs. I have worked extensively with automated CI/CD
          tools such as
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://concourse-ci.org/"
            >Concourse</a
          >
          and
          <a
            rel="noreferrer"

            href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions"
            >Github actions</a
          >
          for automated testing and deployments. I have developed APIs, tools,
          and plugins using
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/"
            >Golang</a
          >,
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"

          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/"
            >Python</a
          >
          among other programming languages and I am flexible in choosing the
          right tool for the job.

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science is both my profession and my passion. I believe that
          listening to experts in the field and keeping current with the
          evolving landscape helps to keep my skills sharp and add as many tools
          to my software engineering toolbelt as possible. Especially in a time
          when LLMs are chipping away at the average developer's ability to
          problem solve on their own, I strive to learn the technologies I work
          with extensively to keep the quality of software high and bring
          skepticism to generated code. LLMs can be a powerful tool, but they
          require a deep understanding of the problem at hand to ask the right
          questions and get the best answers. I also have a particular passion
          for

            >functional programming</a

          and enjoy working with languages such as
