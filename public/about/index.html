      <p>Hi, my name is Justin Knueppel</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior at The Ohio State University studying Data analytics. I
          chose this major because I had always been good with math and I found
          a passion for programming as I finished high school. Data Analytics
          has allowed me to pursue both math and computer science for my career.
          Specifically, I chose the computational analytics specialization as I
          have honed in on programming rather than statistics. This has allowed
          me to take courses on software engineering principles, data structures
          and algorithms, systems programming, discrete mathematics, and more.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I spent the majority of 2019 as a claims analytics intern for
          Nationwide Insurance where I learned much about the role of data
          analytics in industry. For the most part, my focus was on developing
          automated systems to streamline the analytics process. I was proud to
          be a strong programmer that could help develop systems that made the
          jobs of everyone on my team more straightforward.

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I began programming in high school by learning Java to create
          Minecraft mods. Since then, I have studied many facets of computer
          science and programming both formally through my course work at Ohio
          State, as well as informally on my own. I have worked through programs
          such as the

          through the University of Helsinky, read books such as

          projcts.
