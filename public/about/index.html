        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          In May 2021, I graduated summa cum loude from The Ohio State
          University with a B.S. in Data Analytics. I chose this major because I
          had always been good with math and I found a passion for programming
          as I finished high school. Data Analytics allowed me to pursue both
          math and computer science for my career. Specifically, I chose the
          computational analytics specialization as I decided to focus on
          programming over statistics. This allowed me to take courses on
          software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms,
          systems programming, discrete mathematics, and more.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I spent the majority of 2019 as a claims analytics intern for
          Nationwide Insurance where I learned much about the role of data
          analytics in industry. For the most part, my focus was on developing
          automated systems to streamline the analytics process. I was proud to
          be a strong programmer that could help develop systems that made the
          jobs of everyone on my team more straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August of 2020, I joined the Comcast Cybersecurity team as a
          Security Developer Contractor. This role has allowed me to work in a
          fast-paced and technologically advanced team and learn many industry
          leading technologies. I have created and deployed applications to
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/"
            >AWS</a
          >
          using
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.terraform.io/"
            >Terraform</a
          >, worked extensively with automated CI/CD tools such as
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://concourse-ci.org/"
            >Concourse</a
          >, programmed tools and plugins using
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/"
            >Golang</a
          >
          and
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"
            >Rust</a
          >, automated maintenance processes with
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/"
            >Python</a
          >
          and
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.ansible.com/"
            >Ansible</a
          >, and have even begun working on a next generation platform that
          utilizes Golang and
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/"
            >Kubernetes</a
          >. Each day working with these tools I continue to gain confidence as
          both a developer and a devops engineer.

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I began programming in high school by learning Java to create
          Minecraft mods. Since then, I have studied many facets of computer
          science and programming both formally through my course work at Ohio
          State, as well as informally on my own. I have worked through programs
          such as the

          >
          through the University of Helsinky, read books such as
